- Pay By Date: Jun 25, 2025 (3 days before closing)
- Can Use Funds: Jul 1, 2025 (3 days after closing)
- Due Date: Jul 23, 2025 (25 days after closing)

**Next Cycle:**
- **Next Closing Date**: Jul 31, 2025 (HIGHLIGHTED)
- Next Pay By Date: Jul 28, 2025
- Next Can Use Funds: Aug 3, 2025

## 🎯 Advanced Credit Float Strategy

**Corrected Timeline Logic:**
1. **Wait for "Can Use Funds" Date**: Jul 1, 2025 (after current cycle reports)
2. **Use Credit Period**: Jul 1 - Jul 28, 2025 (strategic window)
3. **Pay By Date**: Jul 28, 2025 (3 days before next closing)
4. **Next Closing Date**: Jul 31, 2025 (when balance reports to bureaus)

**Key Insight**: The strategy uses NEXT cycle dates after current cycle has reported, giving you a strategic 27-day window to use credit while maintaining excellent scores.
